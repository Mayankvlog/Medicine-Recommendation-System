The Infection Expectation Framework utilizes AI models to foresee potential illnesses in light
of a bunch of client entered side effects. It utilizes a SVC model (Support Vector Classifier) 
prepared on side effect information to foresee the sickness. 

The application gives significant insights concerning the anticipated sickness, including a 
portrayal, insurances, meds, diet proposals, and recommended exercises. 

This is undeniably fueled by datasets containing data about different sicknesses, side effects, 
drugs, and that's only the tip of the iceberg. The framework expects to help clients in 
distinguishing potential circumstances and offering accommodating direction.
